# Logistic Regression and SVM in MATLAB

# Logistic Regression
This project trains and tests a regularized logistic regression model on two data sets, namely the breast
cancer and sonar data sets which are available here: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~cjlin/
libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html#breast-cancer and here: https://www.csie.ntu.edu.
tw/~cjlin/libsvmtools/datasets/binary.html#sonar.

The project is divided into the following tasks:
-Use the 5-fold cross validation method to decide the best value of the parameter C. The best C is the one that yields the lowest validation error.
– Use the selected best C value to train a logistic regression model on the whole training data and evaluate and report its performance (by error rate) on the testing data.
– Report the results on the two data sets.

# SVM
Repeat the same experiment as above using linear, RBF and polynomial kernel SVMs.
